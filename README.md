#Ingamium

Ingamium is a plugin for the free chat client Adium. It allows you to receive messages and reply to them while playing a game without leaving fullscreen mode or quitting the game. You'll simply see the chat messages as overlay on top of your game. Works with all chat protocols Adium supports.

## Features
* Install the plugin with a simple double click – thereafter it's perfectly integrated to Adium, without any further configuration!
* No matter whether you use ICQ, MSN, Aim, Google Talk or any other protocol – Ingamium supports them all!
* Chat with your friends without closing your game
* Ingamium supports about 80 native Mac OS X games, but you can add custom ones with a few clicks
* Configure Ingamium to fit your needs: e.g. Position, color and the behavior of the chat window are customizable
* Use the build-in function to send new games to the developer – they'll be officially included in the next release!
